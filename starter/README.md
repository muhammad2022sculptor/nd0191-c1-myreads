# Hi, I'm Muhammad Shahiryar! ðŸ‘‹

I am an enthusiast programmer or rather a problem solver. I really love learning new things.
It actually doesn't matter what but it must be useful for development of good knowledge.
Yeah that's a bit of intro about me.

# MyRead - a react base application

This application is essentially based off of two different pages first page being
the home page which is also comprise of three sections

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read
  The second page is a search engine specifically for books. The user can search on
  bases of name and the books will be displayed.

## Features

- User can move the books from section to section
- User can delete the book by selecting None from selection dropdown
- User can Add new book by click on round green plus icon in the lower right corner
- This is web based application which only requires browser to run
- User will go to search page where he/she will see a similar book component after he/she search for new book. so they can simply select whatever section they want to put the book in.

## Lessons Learned

While building this project I learned:

- Why is react better and faster way of developing web applications.
- How to use State Management in the different components.
- About Hooks that how powerful they are.
- Also about Routing which helped me to switch between pages faster.

Challanges I faced:

The biggest Challange was the Search algorithm as it required me filter out the books which were already present in the homepage so the information of those books should also be accessible in the searchpage to make the user experience further efficient.
